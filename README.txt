# Maintenance-History-Recorder
 Maintinence-History-Recorder  This completed project allows you to record problems and solutions you have had
 with your devices (Computers, Cars, Ect.) for future reference. 

  **How it works**
  
  Creating a new item allows you to name the item and add entry's.
  
  Entry's are specific dates that a problem occured and how you fixed it.
  
  (you can also change names, delete entry's and items, and redate entry's by right clicking on them.)
  
  Data automatically saves at close and brings up save data upon opening the application.
